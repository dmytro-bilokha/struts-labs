# struts-labs

This repository contains labs from the book [Beginning Apache Struts: From Novice to Professional](http://www.apress.com/9781590596043?gtmf=s).
I changed building system from Windows .bat scripts to Apache Ant and added Apache Ivy for dependencies management.

## Labs Status

* Lab 4 is fully completed, results are in the `custom-jsp-tag` directory.

* Labs from 5 to 14 also completed and tested, results are in the `lilldep` directory.

* Lab 15 (validation with Apache Validator) is also in the `lilldep` sources, but there is
some tricky bug. Currently Apache Validator ignores form and doesn't validate it.
